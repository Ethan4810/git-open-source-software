# My Project Plan

**_Note_**: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.

### Proposal

---

I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.  
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) or [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies

- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmlab
- package manager

### Installation

In a bash terminal, run the following commands (_Do Not actually run these commands in your computer_):

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python --version
$ python example.py
```
